# :loop: Next Steps
- I want to make a store where users can buy credits to enter tournaments with an entry fee

- I want users to be able to gain or lose experience based on their match results, which will in turn give all users a rank they can show off and compare against others

- I want users to be able to create and customize their own profiles, that allows them to show off their trophies from tournaments wins, user rank, etc...

- I want other users to be able to reply and interact with others' forum posts like an active forum page
